## Hello there

I am Avneet, 3rd year Computer Science Undergraduate at IIT Guwahati, India. I am a software developer with interests in image processing, computer vision and cryptology.

## When, What, Why

This is a blog on mathematics, computer science, random things ...
I mean to use this as notes for myself, to keep all that information in one place. But if you find it useful, let me know :upside_down:
